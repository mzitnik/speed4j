0.18
====

* Merged in support for bulk operations from Mark Zitnik.

0.17
====

* Slowlog no longer uses memory if the feature is turned off.

0.16
====

* PeriodicalLog output is now sorted.

0.15
====

* Bug fix release.  Possible backwards compatibility issue: the ObjectName
  used to register Speed4J into JMX has had one space removed (it was
  impossible to see in jconsole for example).

0.14
====

* Added slow log (finally some use for those Messages).  
  See README for more info.

* Added tagFieldWidth attribute to PeriodicalLog so that you can
  treat your OCD by making sure all your logs line up.

* Added the ability to set another config file name programmatically
  with StopWatchFactory.getInstance( filename, factoryname );

* #18: PeriodicalLog logging is now both readable and settable through
  JMX.
  
* #19: Support for Statsd

* PeriodicalLog can now also calculate any percentile you want.  By
  default it uses 95th, but you can set it with something like this
  
  speed4j.<mylogger>.percentiles = 99, 99.9, 99.99

  See README for more information
  
0.13
====

* #12: Added space between message and time.

* #14: New FormattedStopWatch class to provide machine-readable StopWatches

* API now prefers microseconds all around

* Allows setting of the property file from the command line using
  -Dspeed4j.properties=myfile.properties

* #13: PeriodicalLog now allows explicit mode settings, JMX_ONLY, LOG_ONLY,
  QUIET or ALL.

* Improved output of PeriodicalLog to handle longer tags.

0.12
====

* Speed4j core now requires only Java 5.  Added note about PeriodicalLog requiring
  Java6.  Thanks to Brad Fitz!

* Documentation fixes, again thanks to Brad!

0.11
====

* Improved Perf4j compatibility by adding StopWatch.getElapsedTime()

0.10
====

* Much improved memory management: The StopWatch queue size has now a maximum limit
  (to prevent a case where a producer would just keep sending stuff that we couldn't
  process fast enough).  Also, the StopWatch queues are now emptied as quickly
  as possible.

* Added new internal JMX attribute: "DroppedStopWatches" to monitor StopWatches
  which are dropped when they can't fit in the queue.

* There's another new internal JMX attribute: "StopWatchQueueLength" which you
  can use to directly monitor whether Speed4j is keeping up with the incoming
  events.

* You can now shut up the PeriodicalLog logging by simply setting the slf4jLogName
  to an empty string.

* PeriodicalLog now requires Java 6 for j.u.c.LinkedBlockingDeque.  Speed4j can
  only be used on Java 5 VM if PeriodicalLog is not used.
